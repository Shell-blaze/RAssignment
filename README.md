# R Assignment 1

This repository contains the first assignment for the R course. The main focus of this assignment is to demonstrate the ability to process and analyze data using R, and to document the analysis in an R Markdown file which is then rendered to a PDF document.

## Files in this Repository

- `R-Assignment-1.Rmd`: The R Markdown file containing the code and analysis.
- `R-Assignment-1.pdf`: The rendered PDF document with the code and output.
- `players.csv`: The dataset used for analysis (assuming it's included in the repository).

## Summary of the Assignment

In this assignment, we performed the following tasks:

1. **Data Loading**: Loaded the `players.csv` dataset into R.
2. **Data Sampling**: Performed data sampling to create a subset of the data.
3. **Analysis and Visualization**: Conducted basic data analysis and created visualizations using `ggplot2`.
4. **Documentation**: Documented the code and analysis in an R Markdown file and generated a PDF report.

## How to View the Analysis

To view the analysis, you can simply open the `R-Assignment-1.pdf` file which contains all the code and its corresponding output.

## How to Reproduce the Analysis

To reproduce the analysis, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine using the following command:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Shell-blaze/RAssignment.git
